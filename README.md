This is BETA version and requires feedback (Test).

However there is new features:
 - Configuration is externalized into XML to make it easy to use
 - Configuration can be reloaded any time by typing in the chat ".getreward reload" (Only by GM)
 - Reward is highly flexible now its separated in groups and each group has its own chance keep in mind that only one item per group can be selected, so if you need multiple rewards make multiple groups! (The sum of the chance inside a group must always be equals to 100 in order to preserve proper chance to get any item inside selected)
 - There is support for colored names of players while they are votted
 - The messeges were externalized too so u can make them on any language
